  <h1> Western Queens Community Land Trust wants to tell you how to use public land </h1>

  <div class="header container intro">
    <p> There’s a piece of public land in Astoria and a Community Land Trust (CLT) vying to get ahold of it.
      The land itself is surrounded by the NYCHA Ravenswood Houses on the corner of 21st Street and 35th Avenue, and is currently owned by the city.
      On the land is a Department of Sanitation garage that is set to close. Now, the Western Queens Community Land Trust has begun holding visioning sessions with neighborhood residents, mostly of the surrounding public housing, in the hopes of
      convincing the city to use the land to benefit the community.
      The Western Queens CLT, is a non-profit formed by a coalition of community members (neighborhood residents, small business owners, artists, activists, professors, etc.), who aspire to keep “public land in the hands of the public.”
      For them, that means allowing community members make decisions when it comes to spaces that would affect them if they were to get in the hands of the “big developers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At the visioning session in early September, more than a dozen neighborhood residents came together around the Ravenswood flagpole and talked about what they hoped to add to their community;
      be it “truly-affordable” housing for families or seniors, a community center, or a park.
    </p>

    <p> As Community Land Trusts become more popular citywide as a way to protect the public land from powerful developers, explaining the nitty-gritty behind CLTs gets heavy and confusing.
      But visually, showing that the objective of a the CLTs is to bring people together with a common goal of community development seems easier to grasp.
